### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Repos !!

### BIO

I started coding when I was younger with Basic and applescript, I created my first app called  â€˜netscape sweeperâ€™.  It was basic and simple and would wipe the cache of netscape, something unheard of at the time!  I sold that piece of code to an american company and made a little money;  that was only the startâ€¦

My background includes numerous positions in IT and Physical Security as team leader or project manager. Comprised as: work for the SQ Communications (SuretÃ© du QuÃ©bec), many years as a national park ranger, Canadian Communications specialist for the Canadian forces, overseas consulate representative for the Canadian government, and a First Responder and trained volunteer fireman.

In addition, I have a  deep-rooted experience with such technologies as computers (specializing in Linux and open source software), electronics, communications (installation and repair, even in difficult terrain), and maintains an Amateur Radio License (VE2DRG). I am fluent in French, English and Spanish, and I earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Sherbrooke.

Iâ€™m always open to new ideas projects, just contact me

Cheers!

Dan
