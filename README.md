# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my repository collection!

## About Me

My journey in coding began at a young age, dabbling in BASIC and AppleScript. I developed my first application, 'Netscape Sweeper,' which was a simple yet innovative tool for clearing Netscape's cache. This creation was eventually sold to an American company, marking the start of my passion for coding.

Throughout my career, I've held various IT and physical security roles, including team leader and project manager positions. My experience spans working with SQ Communications (Sûreté du Québec), serving as a National Park Ranger, specializing in communications for the Canadian Forces, representing the Canadian government at overseas consulates, and volunteering as a First Responder and trained firefighter.

As a tech enthusiast, I'm well-versed in computers (with a focus on Linux and open-source software), electronics, and communications (including installation and repair in challenging environments). I hold an Amateur Radio License (VE2DRG) and am fluent in French, English, and Spanish. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Sherbrooke.

Feel free to reach out if you have any exciting ideas or projects in mind!

Best regards,

Dan
