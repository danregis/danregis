### Hi there 👋

### Welcome to my Repos !!

### BIO

I started coding when I was younger with Basic and applescript, I created my first app called  ‘netscape sweeper’.  It was basic and simple and would wipe the cache of netscape, something unheard of at the time!  I sold that piece of code to an american company and made a little money;  and so it began…

My background includes numerous positions in IT and Physical Security as team leader or project manager. Comprised as: work for the SQ Communications (Sureté du Québec), many years as a national park ranger, Canadian Communications specialist for the Canadian forces, overseas consulate representative for the Canadian government, and a First Responder and trained volunteer fireman.

In addition, I have a  deep-rooted experience with such technologies as computers (specializing in Linux and open source software), electronics, communications (installation and repair, even in difficult terrain), and maintains an Amateur Radio License (VE2DRG). I am fluent in French, English and Spanish, and I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Sherbrooke.

I’m always open to new ideas projects, don't be shy; just contact me!

Cheers!
